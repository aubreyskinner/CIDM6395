### Project Proposal
#### Project Idea:
Develop a web-based marketplace and financial management platform for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), with features that serve both CNAs and clients. The system will function like Craigslist but tailored for home healthcare. It will offer: <br>
• CNA profiles with credentials, rates, availability, location, and experience
• Client search and booking based on needs, time, and location
• Job scheduling and payment scheduling 
• Financial tracker for CNAs to manage income and expenses
#### Problems Addressed:
CNAs often juggle irregular hours, multiple clients, and out-of-pocket expenses. Current tools such as spreadsheets and calculators do not offer industry-specific insights; there is no unified platform for connecting clients and CNAs directly that also adds the layer of financial tracking. 
#### Expanded Scope:
* Multiple user types: CNAs and clients
* Tools Included: Reviews/ ratings, availability management, and price estimators
* Forecasting and Analytics: Predict demand and/or client trends to see how much work might be available next month
* Shared System: Encourages long-term client-provider relationships, repeat business, and trust
#### Circular Areas Addressed: 
1. Software Systems: web application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend) and Python (FastAPI or Django) (backend). A MySQL database will be used for secure storage of user data and service logs. 
2. Business Analytics: CNA dashboard with visual insights- income spent on job-related expenses, average income per week/month, forecast available work. Client-side analytics for reviews, booking, and service cost.
3. Data Management: Secure, scalable storage for CNA and client profiles, income/expense tracking entries, and review and rating history.
