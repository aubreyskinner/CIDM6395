### About Me
I am a graduate student in the MS-CISBA program at West Texas A&M University. I have a passion for building data-driven software systems that bridge the gaps between business, technology, and analytics.
This portfolio contains the evolution of my work across the core areas of the program:
* Software Systems
* Business Analytics
* Data Management
* Networking and Cybersecurity
