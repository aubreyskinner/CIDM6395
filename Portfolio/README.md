### About Me
I was a graduate student in the Master of Science in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics (MS-CISBA) program at West Texas A&M University, graduating in May of 2025. I am passionate about building data-driven software systems that bridge the gaps between business, technology, and analytics.
For my Capstone project, I designed and implemented a full-stack web application that brings together four core areas of the MS-CISBA curriculum.
This portfolio contains the evolution of my work across those areas:
* Software Systems
* Business Analytics
* Data Management
* Networking and Cybersecurity
### Portfolio Contents and How the Project Synthesizes the Curriculum
Each section below represents one of the four curricular areas from the MS-CISBA program. Inside each folder, you'll find a self-assessment, sample works, and a discussion of how the subject integrates with other disciplines.
#### Software Systems (SS)
Contains a reflection of my experience with software development, including:
* API creation using FastAPI and Django
* Repository pattern implementations
* CRUD operations and ERD modeling<br><br>
See [Software Systems](SoftwareSystems/README.md) for full reflection and examples.
#### Business Analytics (BA)
Showcases my strengths in:
* Model evaluation (F1, confusion matrix)
* Dashboard creation using Tableau and Power BI
* Predictive modeling and feature selection <br><br>
See [Business Analytics](DataAnalytics/README.md) for full reflection and examples.
#### Data Management (DM)
Highlights include:
* ER diagrams, normalization, and relationship modeling
* Classification model evaluation
* Data sampling, subsetting, and integration
* Emphasis on privacy, integrity, and real-world interoperability<br><br>
See [Data Management](DataManagement/README.md) for full reflection and examples.
#### Networking and Cybersecurity (CN)
Features work related to:
* Security auditing, incident response, and network monitoring
* Hands-on work with Wireshark, Nmap, and VPN configuration
* Real-world applications in protecting data systems<br><br>
See [Networking and Cybersecurity](NetworkAndCybersecurity/README.md) for full reflection and examples.
### Overall, this Capstone experience provided a hands-on demonstration of how these domains interconnect in the design of the web platform <I>Linkella</i>
