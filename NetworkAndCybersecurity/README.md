## Introduction
This assessment provides a comprehensive evaluation of my knowledge in Networking and Cybersecurity. I will examine areas where I am proficient, areas needing improvement, and gaps in my capabilities that I hope to fill. Supporting evidence, including examples of my previous work and resources I have utilized, will reinforce this evaluation. Furthermore, I will assess how Networking and Cybersecurity integrates with broader domains and explore its practical applications. Throughout my education, I have developed a strong foundation in various techniques, tools, and methodologies, and this assessment serves as an opportunity to reflect on my progress. 

## What I Know
My strongest competencies include:

### Security Auditing
* Performed a security audit for a local company
* Gained hands-on experience on how to investigate security practices
* Identified vulnerabilities and provided recommendations 

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example One](OSRAuditPlan.docx)

### Network Monitoring
* Utilized network monitoring tools to capture and analyze traffic
* Investigated network anomalies

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example Two](ResearchReport2.docx)

<b>Sources Consulted:</b> Wireshark User Guide

### Incident Response
* Developed incident response plans for mitigation of cyber attacks

## Where I Am Weak
Areas I need to improve and strategies used to bridge the gaps:

### 1. Cloud Security 
I can remedy this by utilizing: 
* Enrolling in cloud security certification courses
* Setting up test environments in different cloud platforms 

### 2. Packet Analysis
* I understand the basics, but lack expertise in packet analysis

### 3. Network Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap)
* I have used this type of software once, I lack experience for in-depth vulnerability assessments
  
<b>I can remedy this by:</b>
* Engaging in more Nmap scans
* Practicing hands-on labs such as Hack The Box or TryHackMe
* Deepen my knowledge of interpreting Nmap results

## What I Wish I Knew 
These are skills I recognize as valuable, but have not yet fully developed:

### 1. Firewalls
* I need more practice configuring firewalls and understanding how they operate on a deeper level
 
### 2. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
* I have basic knowledge of how VPNs work, but I need more practical experience

## Summary Statement and Preparedness 
I am continually building upon my knowledge in Networking and Cybersecurity. While I have solid skills in areas such as security auditing, network monitoring, and incident response, I recognize areas in which I need to improve. Cloud security, packet analysis, and network scanning are all topics I am dedicated to further developing through hands-on practice and certification courses. 

## Why Networking and Cybersecurity is Integratable with Other Areas
Networking and Cybersecurity are integral with every field in technology. As businesses increasingly become more dependent on digital infrastructures, network security is critical for safeguarding sensitive data. Networking and Cybersecurity are responsible for handling private data, such as financial information, names, addresses, and even medical reports.

## How Networking and Cybersecurity is Integratable with Other Areas
Networking and Cybersecurity interconnect with various domains, such as data analytics, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure. For example, analyzing network traffic for anomalies can protect a company against security threats. Furthermore, data analytics and cybersecurity work hand-in-hand by using tools to detect potential risks, enabling quicker response times. 

## How Networking and Cybersecurity is Integratable with My Prior Work
My previous experience in system development has emphasized the importance of secure communication and data protection. As I work on the vital sign documentation project, HIPAA compliance is a critical consideration. In this context, Networking and Cybersecurity principles ensure that the data is secure and prevents unauthorized access.
