## Introduction
This assessment provides a comprehensive evaluation of my knowledge in Data Mining and Management. I will examine areas where I am proficient, areas needing improvement, and gaps in my capabilities that I hope to fill. Supporting evidence, including examples of my previous work and resources I have utilized, will reinforce this evaluation. Furthermore, I will assess how Data Management integrates with broader domains and explore its practical applications. Throughout my education, I have developed a strong foundation in various techniques, tools, and methodologies, and this assessment serves as an opportunity to reflect on my progress. 


## What I Know
My strongest competencies include:

### Database Design and Management
* EER Diagrams
* ER Models
* Normalization
* Relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example One](FinalABC.drawio.pdf) [Example Two](Homework3.pdf)

<b>Sources Consulted:</b> Drawio and Figma

### Model Comparisons
* Comparing Classification Models
* Evaluating Clustering Performance

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example Three](ModelComparisons.xlsx)

<b>Sources Consulted:</b> Microsoft Excel, RapidMiner, R

### Data Subsetting and Sampling
* Filtering
* Splitting
* Stratified Sampling

## Where I Am Weak
Areas I need to improve and strategies used to bridge the gaps:

### 1. Advanced SQL
I can remedy this by utlizing: 
* DataCamp Courses 
* Khan Academy
* Jose Portilla's course, "The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2020: Go from Zero to Hero"

### 2. Decision Trees
Specifically, pruning and parameter tuning techniques.

### 3. Making Pivot Tables using Data from RapidMiner

## What I Wish I Knew 
These are skills I recognize as valuable, but have not yet fully developed:

### 1. Anomaly Detection
Essential for identifying errors, frauds, and unusual patterns. 

### 2. Association Rule Mining
Applying this beyond RapidMiner (e.g. Python) would be beneficial. 

### 3. How to Manage Data Privacy
* HIPAA
* GDPR
* Data Encryption

### 4. Data Integration and APIs
* OAuth and API Authentication
* ETL Pipelines with APIs

## Summary Statement and Preparedness 
Through this assessment, I have identified my core competencies in Data Mining and Management, this includes model comparisons, database design, and data subsetting and sampling. My ability to utlize tools such as RapidMiner, R, Drawio, and data visualization platforms has strengthened my approach to problem-solving and data interpretation. Likewise, my experience with classification models, clustering, and relational databases demonstrates my ability to work with structured and unstructured data. I am confident in my ability to contribute to real-world projects while bridging any remaining skill gaps. 

## Why Data Management is Integratable with Other Areas
Data management serves as a foundation for all data related disciplines, it ensures that information is collected, stored, processed, and assessed correctly and efficiently. Proper data managment enables data availability for analytics, ensures structured data storage, and strengthens cybersecurity by enforcing privacy and integrity. 

## How Data Management is Integratable with Other Areas
Data management plays a critical role in supporting real-world applications. In networking- storage solutions, such as Google Drive and Dropbox, rely on data management to store, retrieve, and sync files across multiple devices. Without it, file corruption and data loss become major concerns. In mobile banking apps, it is necessary to ensure user authentication and fraud detection. Data management ensures operational efficiency and enhances security and reliability. 

## How Data Management is Integratable with My Prior Work
Data managment has played a significant role in my prior work; in past projects, I have written SQL queries to manipulate and extract data from relational databases,  which is an essential skill. My exposure to data integration has further shown me the value of APIs and how they enable seamless communication. Additionally, working with data transformation techniques has allowed me to structure and refine raw data into suitable formats for analysis. I have encountered several challenges in handling missing and inconsistent data, which has reinforced my understanding of the importance of the data validation process.
