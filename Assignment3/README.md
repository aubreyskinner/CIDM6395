## Introduction
This assessment provides a comprehensive evaluation of my knowledge in Software Systems. I will examine areas where I am proficient, areas needing improvement, and gaps in my capabilities that I hope to fill. Supporting evidence, including examples of my previous work and resources I have utilized, will reinforce this evaluation. Furthermore, I will assess how Software Systems integrate with broader domains and explore its practical applications. Throughout my education, I have developed a strong foundation in various techniques, tools, and methodologies, and this assessment serves as an opportunity to reflect on my progress. 


## What I Know
My strongest competencies include:

### Repository Pattern Implementation
* Designed repository layers for different storage solutions (CSV, In-Memory, and SQL)
* Followed best practices for code maintenance

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example One](https://github.com/aubreyskinner/CIDM6330-Spring2025/tree/3bfceeddce9acddd0add0af3083889cfb23ab49d/Assignment%203/repositories) 

<b>Sources Consulted:</b> FastAPI documentation and course materials (FastAPI/Pydantic Tutorials)

### CRUD Operations
* Use MySQL for database interactions
* Performed CRUD operations in Python and C# in Visual Studio Code

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example Two](https://github.com/aubreyskinner/CIDM6330-Spring2025/tree/3bfceeddce9acddd0add0af3083889cfb23ab49d/Assignment%202/CIDM6330-Code)

### Developing APIs with FastAPI
* I developed an API for digitizing vital sign documentation
* Used MySQL for database interaction and created an ERD for structure

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example Three](https://github.com/aubreyskinner/CIDM6330-Spring2025.git)

## Where I Am Weak
Areas I need to improve and strategies used to bridge the gaps:

### 1. Testing  
*  Writing test cases to verify system functionality
I can remedy this by:
* engaging in individual projects to gain practice
* implementing test-driven development (TDD) in future projects

### 2. Version Control with Git
* I have only worked with branches and resolving merge conflicts for one project
* This is a highly valuable skill and I would like to gain experience in this area

### 3. Writing Comprehensive Documentation
* I need to practice better record-keeping skills and document more frequently

## What I Wish I Knew 
These are skills I recognize as valuable, but have not yet fully developed:

### 1. Cloud Development
* I have only worked with Azure and it was for a limited time
* Google Cloud and AWS are platforms that would be beneficial to learn as well

### 2. Machine Learning

### 3. Command Shell
* Basic knowledge of navigating
* Not proficient enough to write shell scripts

### 4. Algorithms
* I understand basic loops and conditionals but lack experience in the larger world of algorithms
