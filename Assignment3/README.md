## Introduction
This assessment provides a comprehensive evaluation of my knowledge in Software Systems. I will examine areas where I am proficient, areas needing improvement, and gaps in my capabilities that I hope to fill. Supporting evidence, including examples of my previous work and resources I have utilized, will reinforce this evaluation. Furthermore, I will assess how Software Systems integrate with broader domains and explore its practical applications. Throughout my education, I have developed a strong foundation in various techniques, tools, and methodologies, and this assessment serves as an opportunity to reflect on my progress. 

## What I Know
My strongest competencies include:

### Repository Pattern Implementation
* Designed repository layers for different storage solutions (CSV, In-Memory, and SQL)
* Followed best practices for code maintenance

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example One](https://github.com/aubreyskinner/CIDM6330-Spring2025/tree/3bfceeddce9acddd0add0af3083889cfb23ab49d/Assignment%203/repositories) 

<b>Sources Consulted:</b> FastAPI documentation and course materials (FastAPI/Pydantic Tutorials)

### CRUD Operations
* Use MySQL for database interactions
* Performed CRUD operations in Python and C# in Visual Studio Code

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example Two](https://github.com/aubreyskinner/CIDM6330-Spring2025/tree/3bfceeddce9acddd0add0af3083889cfb23ab49d/Assignment%202/CIDM6330-Code)

### Developing APIs with FastAPI
* I developed an API for digitizing vital sign documentation
* Used MySQL for database interaction and created an ERD for structure

<b>Sample Work:</b> [Example Three](https://github.com/aubreyskinner/CIDM6330-Spring2025.git)

## Where I Am Weak
Areas I need to improve and strategies used to bridge the gaps:

### 1. Testing  
*  Writing test cases to verify system functionality
I can remedy this by:
* engaging in individual projects to gain practice
* implementing test-driven development (TDD) in future projects

### 2. Version Control with Git
* I have only worked with branches and resolving merge conflicts for one project
* This is a highly valuable skill and I would like to gain experience in this area

### 3. Writing Comprehensive Documentation
* I need to practice better record-keeping skills and document more frequently

## What I Wish I Knew 
These are skills I recognize as valuable, but have not yet fully developed:

### 1. Cloud Development
* I have only worked with Azure and it was for a limited time
* Google Cloud and AWS are platforms that would be beneficial to learn as well

### 2. Machine Learning

### 3. Command Shell
* Basic knowledge of navigating
* Not proficient enough to write shell scripts

### 4. Algorithms
* I understand basic loops and conditionals but lack experience in the larger world of algorithms

## Summary Statement and Preparedness 
Throughout my academic career, I have gained strong foundational knowledge along with hands-on experience in Software Systems. I have a main focus on database management, API development, and software design. While proficient in several core areas, I recognize that I have the opportunity to improve in testing, version control, and documentation. I appreciate more advanced topics such as cloud computing and machine learning; gaining skills in these areas would promote my adaptability and allow me to become better equipped for more complex projects.

## Why Software Systems are Integratable with Other Areas
Software Systems act as a backbone for virtually all applications. We use them in healthcare, online shopping, finance, and so much more. Their ability to handle large amounts of data and integrate with other systems makes them highly flexible for various domains. 

## How Software Systems are Integratable with Other Areas
Software Systems can integrate with other areas such as data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence. For example, integrating a healthcare application with a data analytics platform can provide patient insights. Software Systems can connect with external systems and data sources and this makes them incredibly functional. 

## How Software Systems are Integratable with My Prior Work
In previous projects, I have developed systems that require interaction with databases and external data sources. For example, in my vital sign documentation API, I used MySQL to store and retrieve patient data, which could even be expanded to integrate with machine learning models in the future. The experience I have gained from working on this project has provided me with a vast array of skills that can evolve as my expertise grows.
